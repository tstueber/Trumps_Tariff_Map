                  <strong>EU Tariff Suspension Notice:</strong><br>
                  As of April 14, 2025, the EU suspended retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods for 90 days to allow negotiations.
                  This suspension covers 25% tariffs on €21B worth of American products like poultry, beef, soybeans, and industrial goods.
                  The pause followed President Trump's tariff freeze. Tariffs may resume if no deal is reached by mid-July 2025.
